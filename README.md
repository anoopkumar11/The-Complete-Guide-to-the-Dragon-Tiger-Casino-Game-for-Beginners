It is also stress free. You do not have to remember anything or use a calculator like in poker or blackjack. You just relax, watch the cards, and feel the thrill when the dealer flips them.

It is simple enough for anyone, but still exciting enough to keep you watching and playing again and again.

# **Gambling Risk**

[Gambling risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling) refers to the chance of losing money while betting or playing casino games. Every game depends on luck, so there is no guaranteed way to win.  

Many people gamble for fun, but it can become risky if done without control. Losing more than you can afford, chasing losses, or gambling to escape stress can lead to serious financial and emotional problems.  

Responsible gambling means setting limits, knowing when to stop, and treating it as entertainment, not a way to earn money.
